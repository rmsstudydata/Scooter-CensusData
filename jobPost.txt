Brussels - Belgium

Chicago - USA

Washington DC - USA

Detroit - USA

Lisbon - Portugal

Madrid - Spain

2- Area (KM^2)

3- Male to Female Ratio

4- Unemployment Rate 

5- Average Income per house

6- Percentage of population with ages between 15-35

7- Race distribution (e.g., black, white non-Hispanic, Asian, etc)

8- Zip Code 

9- Total House Units

10- Political Inclination
